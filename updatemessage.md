Version 0.2 ig

oh my god my program is so broken

it turns out all of my eccentricity math was way off so i fixed that. also i added some helpful arrows on the diagram to give a better sense of where the spacecraft is.

if you tried the burn function... sorry broski i said it already. setting my apoapsis to itself cost 86 dV and trying to do it again cost NEGATIVE TWO THOUSAND WHAT

also i've all but given up on the mac releases because idk whats going on with that

the stuff i talked about with the payload goals for this are still in my mind, just that now i see that there are many more priorities
